        Returns the structured logs created during the execution of EVM between two blocks (excluding start) as a JSON object. This endpoint must be invoked via debug_subscribe as follows:

        **NOTE:** Don't trace too many blocks at the same time as it can overuse machine resources.

        **JSONRPC:** `debug_traceChain`
