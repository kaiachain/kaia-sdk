      description: |
        Creates a new subscription to specific events by using either RPC Pub/Sub over WebSockets or filters over HTTP. It allows clients to wait for events instead of polling for them.
        
        The node will return a subscription id for each subscription created. For each event that matches the subscription, a notification with relevant data is sent together with the subscription id. If a connection is closed, all subscriptions created over the connection are removed.
        
        **JSONRPC:** `eth_subscribe`
