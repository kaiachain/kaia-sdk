      description: |
        The stopWS is an administrative method that closes the currently open WebSocket RPC endpoint. As the node can only have a single WebSocket endpoint running, this method takes no parameters, returning a boolean whether the endpoint was closed or not.        
       
        **JSONRPC:** `admin_stopWS`
